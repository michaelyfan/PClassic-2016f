# Philadelphia Classic 2016 Fall solutions

Notes:
- runtimes for all testcases must be under five seconds
- testcases folder contains PClassic's official testcases
- the IN and OUT txt files *not* in /testcases are sample testcases given at the start of the competition
- Treasons and Senators (#7)'s problem description provides no explanation for what to do if two or more sets of anagrammable words tie for being the largest. This is likely a mistake of the creators. This fringe case only happens in one of the test cases, but for that particular case my output differs from theirs.

Completed problems (works for all of PClassic's testcases):
- SudokuSolver (#8)
- FastidiousFarming (#6)
- Tricky (#5)
- Treasons (#7)
